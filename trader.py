# The Python code below is the minimum code that is required in a submission file:
# 1. The "datamodel" imports at the top. Using the typing library is optional.
# 2. A class called "Trader", this class name should not be changed.
# 3. A run function that takes a tradingstate as input and outputs a "result" dict.

from typing import Dict, List
from datamodel import OrderDepth, TradingState, Order


class Trader:

    def run(self, state: TradingState) -> Dict[str, List[Order]]:
        """
        Takes all buy and sell orders for all symbols as an input,
        and outputs a list of orders to be sent
        """
    
        result = {}
        return result
